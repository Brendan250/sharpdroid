// sharpemu-android host layer — reading a guest x86-64 call's arguments out of the spilled state.
//
// this is the piece both thunks stand on, and it is here rather than in either of them because
// there is exactly one right answer and two copies of it would be two chances to be wrong.
//
// FEXCore spills the *entire* guest state, GPRs and FPRs alike, before every syscall
// (JIT/BranchOps.cpp DEF_OP(Syscall), GPRSpillMask = FPRSpillMask = ~0U), so at a thunk trap
// CPUState is a complete and exact description of the guest's registers at the call. that is what
// lets one 16-byte stub shape serve any number of entry points with different signatures: the
// *host* reads the arguments according to the SysV AMD64 classification, so no stub ever has to
// know anything about its own prototype.
//
// the classification is cut down to what a C API without by-value aggregates uses: INTEGER for
// everything that is not floating point, SSE for what is, and a return value that is always in
// RAX. Next<T>() static_asserts the "no aggregates" half, so a header that grows a by-value struct
// parameter stops the build instead of quietly reading the wrong register.
//
// and there is **no pointer translation anywhere**, which is the single biggest thing route B
// buys: guest and host share one address space 1:1, so a guest pointer is already a host pointer
// and every structure the guest fills in is read by the real library in place.
